<p>I wanted to have a blog site for a long time, but it never happened due to procrastination. I had this thought in my mind that I donâ€™t have anything to write because of which I never went ahead. I am going to change this now. I am going to document my journey, learnings, and failures here.</p>
<h1 id="do-it%2C-don%E2%80%99t-wait.">Do it, donâ€™t wait.</h1>
<p>While I was doing some random stuff today, it sparked in my mind that I should check if a domain on my name is available. I went to GoDaddy and bought it instantly as I found it otherwise I would have delayed it and most probably wouldnâ€™t have brought it. Since I decided to get the domain without a second thought, I am writing this post, so just starting helps. I learned it the hard way.</p>
<p>I believe this applies to all other kinds of stuff that we want to do in our life if we start we will find ways to go ahead, apart from spending on unnecessary things :p, please donâ€™t do that otherwise you will end up messing up your financials :D</p>
<h1 id="what-am-i-going-to-write">What am I going to write</h1>
<p>I am thinking of writing about new projects that I am working on, hackathon experiences (past as well if I participate in the new ones), life lessons, tutorials on few things for which I didnâ€™t find many resources on the internet.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>I hope I will be able to write new articles and share my journey.</p>
